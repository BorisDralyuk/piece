Welcome to CodeSparks' FED task

Included with this file is a very simple client-side app.
Your mission, is to improve it a bit by implementing the following additional features:
1) Make the piece "hollow" when the mouse hovers over it (hollow means only a border should be drawn)
2) The `init` function has too much code duplication - fix it 
3) Add a 'reset' button that returns the piece back to its initial location
4) Add a 'randomize' button that places the piece at a random location
5) Make sure that the piece never gets off the screen
6) When the page loads, get today's temperature from an API and set the piece's color according to the following ranges:
    <10 degrees: Blue
    11 - 20 degrees: Green
    21 - 30 degrees: Yellow
    >30 degrees: Red
You can use this URL to retrieve the weather data for Tel-Aviv:
http://api.apixu.com/v1/current.json?key=dda6e762ae4f41efb7e173552192204&q=tel%20aviv
7) How would you improve the code of this project? Give some suggestions


Once done, please send back the new and improved version.

Thanks and good luck!
